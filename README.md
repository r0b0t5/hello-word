# hello-word

r0b0t5 is my name.  It's pronounced "robots".  But it's spelled with a "5" because I'm cooler than cool, and I think I'm some kind of hacker master or something.  Only problem is, I'm just learning to code, so I'm a leet-speak poser, basically.  I do however think robots in general are super cool, and I totes want to invent new ones and program them and stuff.
